## Port Conventions

| Frontend       | `808x`     |
| Backend (APIs) | `818x`     |
| Databases      | `828x`     |
| Debug          | `838x`     |

## Service Ports

Here is the mapping of each service to its accessible port:

| Service Name                   | External Port | Internal Port |
|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Frontend                       | 8080          | 80            |
