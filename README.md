## Getting Started

To run the entire application stack (book-service, user-service, and frontend) with their respective databases, use docker-compose.

1. Clone the Repository (if you havenâ€™t already):
    
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-application.git
   cd book-application
   ```
   
2. Build and start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```

This will start:

- The book-service on port 8092.
- The user-service on port 8091.
- The frontend on port 8083.
- PostgreSQL databases for both the book-service and the user-service on ports 5441 and 5440 respectively.

You can access the frontend at http://localhost:8083.

3. Stopping services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
